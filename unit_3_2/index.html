			<p class="article">I was born December 14, 2014 in Florida, so i'm almost three!  When I was 4 months I moved from a farm in Florida to Washington, D.C. My mom and dad are show dogs, but I spend my time walking around the city instead of a show ring. Over the past 2 years I've become used to the noise and bustle of the city, and one of my favorite activites now is sitting in the park just watching people go by. Most people have no idea what kind of dog I am...a pug? A puggle?  A tiny boxer?  So I'm on a mission to educate people about the wonderful world of Brussels Griffons. </p>
