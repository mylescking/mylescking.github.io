		<p>Hi there!  I'm a Brussels Griffon named Aurelien, but that's a big name for a little dog, so I go by Auri. I was born December 14, 2014 in Florida, so i'm almost three! When I was 4 months I moved from a farm in Florida to Washington, D.C. Over the past few years I've become used to the noise and bustle of the city, and one of my favorite activites now is sitting in the park just watching people go by. Most people have no idea what kind of dog I am...a pug? A puggle?  A tiny boxer?  So I'm on a mission to educate people about the wonderful world of Brussels Griffons. </p>

		<a href="#"> <h3>The Brussels Griffon...where did we come from?</h3></a>
		<p> Most people have never seen a Brussels Griffon...or if they have, they think we're an Ewok! But don't worry, you don't have to go to a galaxy far far away to find a Griffon. The Brussels Griffon, or the Griffon Bruxellois if you really want to be fancy, is a breed of toy dog named for our city of origin, Brussels, Belgium. While many Brussels Griffon's are known for their longer wiry hair and particularly their beards, I'm actually a smooth-haired variety, or a Petit Braban√ßon.</p> <br> <p>Brussels Griffons originate from terrier-like dogs kept in stables to elimiate rodents. In the 19th century, these Griffons were bred with the Pug and King Charles Spaniel to create our distinct look. With our distincitve pout and wide-eyes you might say we look like grumpy humans. In the 19th century we grew in popularity as companion dogs, even with Queen Marie Henriette. Dispite a starring role in <em>As Good as It Gets</em> the Griffon has never been as popular in the US as other toy dogs, but I think that means finding me or one of my friends is just more exciting.</p>
